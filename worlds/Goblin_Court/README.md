# ⚖️ Goblin Court – Setting Hub

Welcome to the Goblin Court setting—where divine law meets petty grudges, bureaucracy tangles with magic, and goblins in robes try to hold it all together. This is a world of magical litigation, temple-bound truth, and the dry absurdity of justice handled one odd case at a time.

This folder collects all works set in the Goblin Court universe. For now, it links to short stories living in the main `/short_stories/` directory, but may grow to include setting notes, character profiles, or longer works.
