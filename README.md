# 📝 Creative Writing Practice – by Kyle Robert Ashburn

This repository contains my creative writing practice.

Within it, you’ll find subfolders organized by category—short stories, novel drafts, etc.—and further organized by setting where relevant. These pieces represent my experimentation with tone, structure, and style. Some are more complete than others; all are part of the process.

These works are here to help me track my growth as a writer and (hopefully) provide some entertainment for anyone curious enough to explore them.

## 📂 Structure
- `/short_stories/`: Self-contained tales, often fantasy or speculative in nature.
- `/novels/`: Early drafts, worldbuilding, or chapter explorations.
- `/worlds/`: Optional setting-focused collections that group stories from multiple categories (e.g., short stories and novels that share a setting). Not all stories are grouped this way, but when they are, they live here too.
- Other subfolders may emerge over time as my practice evolves.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I’m not aiming for polish here—just practice. This repo acts as a sandbox for ideas, voice testing, and creative habits. It’s part record, part playground.

Thanks for stopping by.

If a world keeps nagging at me—or a character just refuses to go quietly—I collect related stories under `/worlds/`. That’s how *Goblin_Court* got promoted from one short story to a full setting.
