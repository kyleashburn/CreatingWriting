# A Goblin Court *(working title)*  
## *by Kyle Robert Ashburn*

The Honorable Goblin Judge, Hawskins Piddleworth the 3rd, sighed as he got ready for the case he was presiding over for the day. As he struggled into the uncomfortable robes, adorned with runes for truth, wisdom, and protection, not all who entered the court respected it, he was quietly thankful the stupid wigs were optional, damned itchy things too. Shaking his head at the folly of the past, he schooled his expression and left his chambers for his courtroom.

***
As Judge Hawskins ascended to the bench he cast a glance around the courtroom. Nodding to the court reporter and his clerk, he took a seat while casting a final glance at the plaintiff and the defendant. Inwardly he cringed seeing that the barrister for the defence was an elf and that the barrister for the plaintiff was a dwarf. “Great, this is going to be a shit show.”, he thought to himself. 

A seasoned judge, his face showed none of his thoughts as he called for counsel to approach the bench. 

“Please introduce yourselves if you please.”

The inevitable jockeying for the perceived good graces of the court began immediately as the two spoke over each other. 

Sighing in his head, feeling a headache come on, but keeping his face carefully schooled, Judge Hawskins cooly held up a hand and said “One at a time in my courtroom please. Plaintiff first then defense.”

Nodding, the dwarf began “Your honor, barrister for the plaintiff, Imlad Stonebeard. I trust our truth shall ring like well-forged steel and you’ll rule in our favor.”

“We shall see.” Judge Hawskins replied, already gesturing to the elf towering over the dwarf.

“Judge Piddleworth, it’s a great hon-” the elf began before being cut off by a gesture from the judge.

“Judge Piddleworth was my father, I’m Judge Hawskins if you please barrister.”

“Apologies Judge Hawskins. I am Dame Hazel Eldersong, barrister for the defense. I apologize for this spurious and groundless claim which was brought befo-” the elf ended awkwardly as the Judge cut her off once again. 

“I will not tolerate showboating or any acts that fail to show the proper respect to the court and to justice. I would remind you that all judges are priests of the god of justice. This is not just a profession, it’s a calling. Keep that in mind.” Judge Hawskins said as he gave a hard look to each barrister before him. 

Much subdued, the two of them nodded their understanding before heading back to their tables. 

“Officers of the court, spectators, we are gathered together today under the watchful eye of lord Ghlorbital, god of Justice. We are here to hear the truth, to see justice done, without fear or favor. Let it be known I will not tolerate anything that runs counter the course to Justice. From any present. You have been warned. Now, Dame Eldersong, as the barrister for the defense, you may speak first.”

The elven barrister Dame Hazel Eldersong, long-winded as most elves, started off by recapping the facts of the case and the course of the trial. 

“My client, William Floritran, purveyor of fine goods, sold the client of Barrister Stonebeard, the adventurer Torilok the Orc, merchandise. He did so in good faith, on credit even. Torilok paid by the end of the week and my client assumed all was fine. However, a month later, Torilok accosts him, interrupting a substantial sale to demand a refund and compensation. He alleged that the merchandise was defective and risked his life. Having given a broad overview of the case from our standpoint, I will now begin a detailed accounting. On the 30th of Trilarxis, a Pilfday, my client woke from his slumber at approximately 6 of the clock in the morning. Now he traditionally begins his day breaking his fast with a bowl of cold porridge.” 

Interrupting the elf before she could expand into her clearly planned moment by moment recounting, Judge Hawskins slammed his gavel. In response to the startled look of the elf, Judge Hawskins dryly quipped “Dame Eldersong, not all races are as long-lived as elves. Do keep that in mind as the trial progresses.”

“Apologies your honor. It won’t happen again.”

“The court thanks you. Have you anything further to add?”

“Not at this time Your Honor.”

“Thank you, Dame Eldersong. Barrister Stonebeard, what is your account?”

“My client is an adventurer Your Honor. He is a simple man, an honest man. Floritran trusted him enough to sell to him on credit. And he paid it back within a week. That isn’t the issue here. It’s what was sold that matters. Floritran purchased Holy Water to use against the undead, knowing that the season they rise was coming up and it’d be wise of him to stockpile. However, when he went to use the darn stuff, it was only a little more effective than pissing on them, if you’ll pardon my language.”

Judge Hawskins held up a hand, pausing Stonebeard’s account and gave a hard start to Dame Eldersong who seemed to wilt under his gaze. 

“Dame Eldersong.” Hawskins began cooly, “did you intend to inform the court of the nature of the merchandise? I believe elven memory should be quite capable of remembering my warning mere minutes ago. ”

“I apologize Your Honor, it must have slipped my mind.”

“Pray make no further mistakes Dame Eldersong. The patience of the court is not to be tested. You may continue Barrister Stonebeard, with less flowery language if you please.”

“Right you are, Yer Honor. My client tried to go back to Floritran for just compensation, like in Orcish custom he sought to avoid portraying Floritran in a bad light until he talked to him. He found he couldna talk to him, no matter how hard he tried to so finally he had no choice but to confront him during the day. And he still refused to compensate my client.”

“Hmmm. And then?”

“My client was told that Floritran wouldn’t see him anymore, would report him to the watch if he came around again, and that anything he had to say would have to go through Dame Eldersong.”

Glancing at Dame Elderson, who again, seemed to shrink away from his gaze, the goblin in the robes asked “At which point he went to you and you brought it before my court?”

“Aye, Yer Honor. Just as you say.”

“Do you have a sample of the holy water in question?” Hawskins asked.

“We do Yer Honor, I thought yer might want to see it, priest that ye are.”

“Luckily for everyone, this can be answered quite easily.”, he said as he turned to look at the elven barrister, “unless Dame Eldersong has something she’d like to say?”

“I know of nothing Your Honor, certainly nothing that would suggest you ought not examine the water in question.”

“Well, then with that approval, we can get started.” Hawskins said, only somewhat dryly, as he gestured to the dwarven barrister. 

Once the vial was placed before him, Hawskins reached out and grasped it in one hand, sensing something wasn’t quite right, he pushed his magic deeper into the vial, examining the water at the sacred grain, relying on the power his god granted him to commune with it. Mentally frowning at what he was told, he put the vial down with a sigh.


“Well. That was illuminating, wasn’t it.”
“Barristers, your clients are waiting outside, yes? As is custom?”

As they both chorused in the affirmative, Hawskins waved to his bailiff to retrieve them, trusting the golem to understand his aim. So useful that they could read his intent, spares so much speech he thought to himself. Truly the wonders of Ghlorbital never ceased to amaze, no matter how old he got. 

As the hulking Orc and corpulent human were guided to their respective barristers, with a moment of confusion as they both attempted to squeeze through the gate to the gallery without either looking at the other or making room. 

Once the room had settled into a semblance of order, Hawskins decided to start his questioning with the Orc. 

“Torilok, can the court trust you to speak only the truth?” 

Baring his teeth in obvious disgust, Torilok merely nodded.

“Very well, would you be able to tell me what you did after you bought the holy water?”

“I stored it in a cool damp place”, the Orc said, his voice gravelly, “like you’re supposed to.”

“And you didn’t take it out until you tried to use it and found it too weak to use?”

“Exactly so your honor.” 

“Then I have no further questions for you Torilok.” Hawskins said as the Orc bowed his head and sat back down. 

“Now then, Floritran. Can you tell me the tale of the water before it left your hands? 

“Certainly Your Honor,” the fat man almost oozed with charm, “I acquired it from a Temple of Tyrith, that god is most against the undead and the best source of holy water like this.”

Holding up a hand, Hawskins said “Let me stop you right there. I communed with the water. I know you’re lying. Care to try again?”

“Why whatever do you mean Your Honor?”

“Spare me the platitudes. You got it from a ‘holy man’ selling it by the bucket outside the temple district. A priest of Zenrich in his time of poverty I’d say, trying to make money how he could. Pity that water isn’t thought to be worth much, Zenrich’s holy water is better at clearing skin blemishes than anything else. Of course, with that knowledge you could make a fortune. The greater pity is that their god forbids them discussing it. And so they remain in poverty.” Hawskins said to the dumbfounded courtroom. 

“But I digress. Would you care to pick up where I left off? Or would you prefer for me to continue?” 

Seeing no response forthcoming from Floritran, Hawskins continued, 
“Unsatisfied with the pennies you pinched, you watered it down from the municipal well, without paying I note, before packaging it in the apartment above your shop. You splashed a bit while you were doing so and muttered to yourself, justifying it by saying ‘people die to the undead all the time, no one will ever know.’ and ‘it could be holy water, I don’t know it isn’t.’ And then you sold it to the plaintiff.”

“How…did you know?” The mass of flesh claiming to be a man stammered out.

“Did you honestly believe that you could lie? In the temple of my god, the god of justice? How big a fool could you be? I communed with the water, it told me all that I said.” Hawskins said, his voice growing colder by the second. 

Floritran’s fists clenched, his face grew splotchy with anger as he rushed the bench in a rage, dodging the powerful but slow golem, he pulled a dagger from his excessively tailored personage. Letting out an inarticulate cry, he struck out at what he clearly believed was the author of his misfortune, Judge Hawskins. 

The courtroom erupted in a panic as the judge looked around the room, Dame Eldersong swooning at her table to be caught by Torilok. Barrister Stonebeard pulled an ax out of seemingly nowhere, Hawskins sighed as he reflected how the magic on the weapon detectors needed renewal. His eyes finally focused on the form of the corpulent merchant’s outstretched arm which slowed and then froze as the tableau all around stopped as well. 

Hawskins sighed as time suddenly reasserted itself and the merchant was flung bodily backward, his flesh rippling from the impact. “Have you quite gotten it out of your system?” He asked dryly.

“I rather suspect my god’s judgement is clear. Now it’s time for my judgement. Floritran. You are a fool who tried to lie to the court, who defrauded an upstanding member of the community, as evidenced by how he caught the barrister who was defending *you*, and who compounded his idiocy by attempting to attack the judge at the trial, in the temple of his god. Each of these compounds on the other.”

“My judgement is that you must liquidate your entire stock, sell your business, and go into exile from this land under penalty of losing your toes. The funds will be distributed as follows: one part in fifteen to the plaintiff, four parts in fifteen to the temple of Zenrich for the crime committed against them, one third of the remaining to the temple of Ghlorbital for the crimes committed here. The remainder, to be paid out to those left impacted by your crimes. Your employees, even your barrister. This is my judgement, let none gainsay it.”

***

With that, the goblin judge headed back into chambers, removed his robes with a sigh and a prayer to his god thanking him for wisdom and protection, and sank back into his comfortable chair, ready to relax. 

Just as he was reaching for a decanter of lizard-folk whiskey, he paused as he saw another file on his desk. “What does My Lord call me to next?” he muttered to himself as reached out to grab it.
